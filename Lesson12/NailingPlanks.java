/**
 * You are given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers. These arrays represent N planks. More precisely, A[K] is the start and B[K] the end of the K−th plank.
 * Next, you are given a non-empty zero-indexed array C consisting of M integers. This array represents M nails. More precisely, C[I] is the position where you can hammer in the I−th nail.
 * We say that a plank (A[K], B[K]) is nailed if there exists a nail C[I] such that A[K] ≤ C[I] ≤ B[K].
 * The goal is to find the minimum number of nails that must be used until all the planks are nailed. In other words, you should find a value J such that all planks will be nailed after using only the first J nails. More precisely, for every plank (A[K], B[K]) such that 0 ≤ K < N, there should exist a nail C[I] such that I < J and A[K] ≤ C[I] ≤ B[K].
 * For example, given arrays A, B such that:
 *     A[0] = 1    B[0] = 4
 *     A[1] = 4    B[1] = 5
 *     A[2] = 5    B[2] = 9
 *     A[3] = 8    B[3] = 10
 * four planks are represented: [1, 4], [4, 5], [5, 9] and [8, 10].
 * Given array C such that:
 *     C[0] = 4
 *     C[1] = 6
 *     C[2] = 7
 *     C[3] = 10
 *     C[4] = 2
 * if we use the following nails:
 * 0, then planks [1, 4] and [4, 5] will both be nailed.
 * 0, 1, then planks [1, 4], [4, 5] and [5, 9] will be nailed.
 * 0, 1, 2, then planks [1, 4], [4, 5] and [5, 9] will be nailed.
 * 0, 1, 2, 3, then all the planks will be nailed.
 * Thus, four is the minimum number of nails that, used sequentially, allow all the planks to be nailed.
 * Write a function:
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A, int[] B, int[] C); }
 * that, given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers and a non-empty zero-indexed array C consisting of M integers, returns the minimum number of nails that, used sequentially, allow all the planks to be nailed.
 * If it is not possible to nail all the planks, the function should return −1.
 * For example, given arrays A, B, C such that:
 *     A[0] = 1    B[0] = 4
 *     A[1] = 4    B[1] = 5
 *     A[2] = 5    B[2] = 9
 *     A[3] = 8    B[3] = 10
 *     C[0] = 4
 *     C[1] = 6
 *     C[2] = 7
 *     C[3] = 10
 *     C[4] = 2
 * the function should return 4, as explained above.
 * Assume that:
 * N and M are integers within the range [1..30,000];
 * each element of arrays A, B, C is an integer within the range [1..2*M];
 * A[K] ≤ B[K].
 * Complexity:
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O((N+M)*log(M));
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(M), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
 * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
